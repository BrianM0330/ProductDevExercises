4) We like to use Vue on our projects. Please Use [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to bootstrap your project
5) Your example doesn't have to look production-ready, but keeping an eye towards responsive layouts and accessible markup are key in our work. We use SCSS frameworks like bootstrap, tailwind to help here.
6) Bonus points for added unit tests or e2e tests
